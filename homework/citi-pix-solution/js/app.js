/*
  User flow:
    1: User changes <select id="city-type">
    2: The page's background changes to a picture of the newly selected city

  Instructions:
    1. Attach the .change() event method to #city-type
    2. Associate the above change event with a function, handleChange, which should do the following:
    3. Create a variable, city, that stores the selected value of #city-type (hint: use .val())
    4. Remove all classes from the <body> element using the .removeClass() method
    5. The variable you created in step 4, corresponds to a CSS class (check in the style.css file for more info)
       Use the .addClass() method to add this variable as a class to <body>

  Bonus: Apply the concept of $(this) - think about what element is causing .change() to fire
*/

$('#city-type').change(handleChange)

function handleChange() {
  var city = $('#city-type').val()

  // refactored using concept of this
  // var city = $(this).val()

  $('body').removeClass().addClass(city)
}
